// HTTP 200
// The HTTP 200 OK success status response code indicates that the request has succeeded. A 200 response is cacheable by default. 
// The meaning of a success depends on the HTTP request method: GET : 
// The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body.

/*The HTTP 300 Multiple Choices redirect status response code indicates that the request has more than one possible responses. 
he user-agent or the user should choose one of them. As there is no standardized way of choosing one of the responses, t
his response code is very rarely used.*/

/*The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 400 Bad Request response status code indicates that the server cannot or will not 
process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (for example, malformed request syntax, invalid 
request message framing, or deceptive request routing).*/
